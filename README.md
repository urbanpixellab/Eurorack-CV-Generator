# Eurorack CV Generator

## Create control voltages from 0 - 5v for eurorack with potentiometers.
This allows to expose eurorack properties which are cv controlled to control the from another controller and make the synthesizer more user adjustable.
=======
# Idea
### make an hardware cv generator for eurorack, like a midicontroler for computer effects but instead with cv for eurorack synthesizers

this means 8 outputchannels daisychainable schematic and board for multiple of 8 outputs

# Proof of Concept
do it for 4 outputs, first build into case after protoboard
